1.0 (19.4.2024)

- first time putting it up on github! Yay
- this version has the following tools: Default, Line, Rectangle (both filled and not filled), Eraser, Text add + undo, clear file button and a button for saving the canvas png on your device
- 12 preset colors
- canvas coordination tracking
- canvas size and brush size can be modified
- neat white css
- you can consider development was started on 18.1.2024, though it was put to the back for most of spring 2024 for the sake of prioritising school
